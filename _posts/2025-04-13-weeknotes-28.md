- Did the White Lotus binge watch catchup this week. It was my least favorite
  season thus far. The "big twist" was very predictable. The Chekov's gun
  situation with the poisonous fruit felt overly goofy. It was all just fine.
- Watched Eddie Burback's [I hate my phone so I got rid of
  it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnsyGSTKlw0). It's a tale you've probably
  heard a thousand times: person stops using their cellphone so much, and is
  happier. But, the video's well done, and inspired at least a temporary
  reduction in my phone staring behavior this week.
- Stumbled upon [Manet](https://tilosoftware.io/manet) music app---a really
  well done iOS (and Mac) app for streaming music from a Jellyfin server. I've
  been increasingly trying to self-host as much SaaS type junk as I can.
  Spotify / Apple Music had been kind of hard to replace, at least on iOS.
  Manet seems to do the trick---it even has CarPlay support! Only thing missing
  now is an Apple Watch app, so I can listen to music without my phone again.
- Been helping out on some spring cleaning at the little community farm down the
  street from me. Met some other dilettante gardeners, young and old. Nice way to
  get in a little exercise, learn some things, meet some folks, and if I'm
  lucky, do a little good for somebody.
- More plant transplantations: all our lettuce is out livin' full time in the
  raised beds.
