- Spent a little time playing around with the MASH stack. Still very much
  learning the basics of Axum (and everything else in the stack, for that
  matter). It's obviously _very_ less "batteries included" than Rails. But it's
  got some neat features that suit Rust quite nicely. The `with_state` function
  pairs up with `Extractors` in such a simple way. I'm impressed!
- Upping my running mileage somewhat. Up to ~10k distance this week. Progress is
  slow, but these legs are returning to form bit by bit.
- Finally completed my porch renovation project with a hefty dose of help from
  my dad. It's comically over-engineered, but if a tornado ever strikes, our
  porch is going nowhere. This is the sturdiest porch east of the Mississippi.
- Speaking of my dad, he just acquired a new motorcycle, which I gave a spin.
  For whatever reason, it re-ignited my need to have a bike. I haven't owned a
  motorcycle since ~2011. So this coming week's projects include: fixing a DMV
  snafu that resulted in my class "M" motorcycle license vanishing from my
  license on my last renewal, and potentially acquiring a bike. Currently
  eyeballing the Honda NX500.
