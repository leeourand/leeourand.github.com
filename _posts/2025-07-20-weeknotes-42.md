- Cyn and I volunteered at the food pantry this week. We picked up donations
  from a couple local grocery stores and restocked the shelves and fridges.
  Feels nice to help, even if it turns out heavy crates of bananas are nature's
  way of reminding you that you're old, and back pain is forever now.
- We’re officially eating homegrown tomatoes and peppers. They taste like
  victory and smell like we may have gone slightly overboard with the compost.
- Pumpkins are growing. They seem happy. Which is a weird sentence to type
  about baby gourds, but I swear, they're vibing.
- I installed the iOS developer beta, and now half my Apple Home automations
  are just... decorative. That one’s on me. Should've known better than to
  install the developer beta. Oops. Hopefully the public beta restores the
  sanctity of our home.
- I discovered Apple Maps lets you save and share custom routes now from their
  "Library" view. But, like, only for walking. Because saving cycling and
  driving directions is still just a bit too complicated, apparently.
- In MotoGP news, Joan Mir must've tripped and fallen face-first into every
  mirror in the mirror factory. Dude has just the worst luck. After that
  calamity of a weekend, the poor guy's flight home was canceled too.
