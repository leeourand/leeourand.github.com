- I read on Reddit that Target had printed some incorrect discount codes on the Meta Quest3. I asked Cynthia to go check it out. Our local Target had apparently already corrected the error. But somehow, Cynthia still walked out of there with a 30% discounted Quest3. So, say hello to a new citizen of the metaverse or whatever.
- [This KTM fiasco just keeps looking more grim by the day](https://www.the-race.com/motogp/ktm-crisis-is-its-motogp-future-under-threat/). Hard to take anything they officially say seriously, either, after their long history of being extremely dishonest.
- Advent of Code has begun. [Sticking to my Go theme, I'm attempting at least some of 'em in Go](https://github.com/leeourand/AOC2025). Working in other languages always makes me realize how spoiled us Rubyists really are. Example I found today: in Go, the absolute value function only works on Floats. So if you want to get the absolute value of an integer, you either have to write your own function (no biggie, but.. y'know) or convert your int to a float, call the function, then convert it back to an int again. Little things like this can sometimes make Go feel borderline anemic.
- [Black Friday shoppers spent a record $10.8 Billion](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/01/g-s1-36310/black-friday-cyber-monday-record-spending). Isn't that crazy? Because less than a month ago, we were all unable to feed our families because inflation was out of control, groceries were too expensive, etc. Wild how quickly that whole conundrum got resolved. Must be some of that good old fashioned American exceptionalism. USA! USA!
- My digestive tract handled the Thanksgiving Day hot pot fiesta just fine! Thanks for askin'.
- Jess had a birthday. We had some beers at the always-lovely Penny Lane Pub.
- We grabbed a ~~Christmas~~ Holiday Tree! It's my first time buying a tree, I think, ever in my adult life. We've got it decked out in some decorative mushrooms (thanks mom).
