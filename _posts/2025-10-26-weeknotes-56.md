- Started the week off with a Hot Pot fiesta with one of Cyn's new buds.
- Been on a teetotaling kick for a bit, and have supplanted my usual
beer-drinking with NA beers. It would appear there's a bit of a trend in this
regard, as there's suddenly a ton of shockingly decent non-alcoholic beer
options around. Favorite of the week was Brooklyn Brewery's [Special Effects
Grapefruit
IPA](https://brooklynbrewery.com/brooklyn-beers/non-alcoholic/special-effects-grapefruit-ipa/).
It is a tasty beverage.
- Went to a friend's little Halloween get-together where we carved some pumpkins, feasted
some s'mores, and watched
[Together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_(2025_film)). T'was a
wonderfully spooky evening.

- Jess and I ran the cap trail 10-miler. We weren't exactly breaking any speed
records, but it was a preeeetty nice time. Weather was perfect. Scenery's lovely
most've the way, even if the route itself is pretty boring (2 out-and-backs).
Probably will do it again next year.
- Took on the task of learning [zhuyin (aka Bopomofo)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo)
this week. It's the Taiwanese phonetic system comparable to pinyin, but without
using roman characters. In theory, this'll help remove the pronunciation
familiarity I have with pinyin, and help me speak actual Chinese sounds instead
of the English-approximations I've been using. ㄨㄛ ㄏㄨㄟ ㄩㄥ ㄅㄆㄇㄈ! \(I
can use bopomofo\)
