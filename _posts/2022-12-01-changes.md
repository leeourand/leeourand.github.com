- It's been over a year. Holy shit. Lots has changed. Let's see...
- We got married! Had a nice little ceremony at a restaurant here in Richmond.
  Jess officiated the thing, and did a damn fine job. It was exactly what we
  wanted.
- We're back in the states, living in Richmond, VA. We've got some family and
  longtime friends in the area. And we're practicing making new buds through via the
  love of whiffleball. Team We Got The Runs went 4-3 this season.
- I've officially transitioned to a management role at work. Still doing lots
  of in-the-weeds programming, so it's been a soft transition so far.
- We got a cat. Her name is Biru (you know, like Ruby, but staggered). She is a bit of a devil. But she is cute.
