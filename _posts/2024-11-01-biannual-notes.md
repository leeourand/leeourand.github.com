- Ah, yes. Continuing my trend of very infrequent updates, I see.
- Some life updates: we bought a house in the suburbs. We (well, I) hated it.
  We sold that house. We bought a new house in Richmond and are much happier. I
  got a new job, back workin' as a lowly individual contributor, and that also
  makes me much happier. Management ain't for me, it turns out. New gig's at
  [Ride with GPS](https://ridewithgps.com). We visited Taiwan. I met my
  in-laws, two nieces and one nephew for the first time. 
- Been watching a bunch of Halloweeny movies. Standouts: [10 Cloverfield
  Lane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179933/),
  [Oddity](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26470109/), and [The Autopsy of Jane
  Doe](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3289956/).
- Speaking of frightening... this damn election is in 4 days. Hold onto your butts...
- Some schmucks stole our Prius's catalytic converter. We currently just share
  that one car, and I'm committed to fixing it myself, so we needed a
  functional set of wheels. I'd been wanting to acquire a Chevy Bolt for a
  while, so this gave me an excuse. So.. we now own a sweet-ass Chevy Bolt, and
  I could'nt be happier with the thing. It's a massive upgrade over the Prius,
  plus there's no risk of catalytic converter theft!
- Jess and I ran in a goofy Halloween 10 Mile race on the Capital Trail last
  week. I'm still recovering from a rough go of bronchitis, so it was a slow
  one. But one of those "in hindsight it was fun" things.
