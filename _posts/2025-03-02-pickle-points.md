title: Pickle Points
subtitle:

- Feels like approximately the 3rd most clich√© activity to pick up, but I
  started playing pickleball this week. Out of the roughly 72 games I've
  played, I've won one (playing doubles where I may or may not have been
  carried). Fun little goofy game, though. I'm enjoyin' it.
- In our [last installment](/posts/2025/02/23/extremely-clean), I incorrectly
  stated the date of National Pancake Day. It's actually *this* Tuesday. Oops!
- This week I learned the Chinese word for "movie" is ÈõªÂΩ±(di√†ny«êng), which literally means
  "electric shadow". I don't know about you, but I think that is one badass way
  to describe a movie.
- I put my long-neglected bicycle to use this week, and went on a nice (slow)
  ride up to Bryan Park and around the Bellevue neighborhood.
- I have no idea what I've done wrong, but the huge majority of my plant babies
  are struuuuuuuuggling. I think only maybe like 5% of them are going to make
  it. Arugula: rough. Jalapenos: rough. Tomatoes: rough. Bell peppers...
  lookin' good!
- First MotoGP race of the season! Haven't seen the race as of writing this,
  but thus far, Marquez looks like he's back to his old
  completely-destroy-everyone-else ways. Usually I'm an underdog fan, but after
  all the shit this dude's been through the past 6 years, I couldn't be happier
  to see him back to his winning ways. 
- Trying to avoid too much political commentary here, but I can't believe
  how embarrassed I feel after seeing how those clowns spoke to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Slava
