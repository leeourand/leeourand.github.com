- Did a big grocery shopping day at the various Richmond Asian markets. Cynthia
  acquired... let's say an upsettingly fragrant amount of stinky tofu. Our house has smelled
  farty much of the week. For one reason or another.
- While shoppin', I eyed this curious beverage from the mean streets of Taiwan:
  ![Peanut soup in a can](/assets/images/articles/peanut-soup.jpg)
  Turns out, milk peanut soup can be surprisingly refreshing! I did accidentally
  spill a tiny bit on my hand, and a couple hours later noticed a small rash
  there. Very strange, considering my innards seemed to handle it just fine. A
  peanuty mystery.
- Got our Prius inspected. I'd been avoiding this since [the catalytic converter
  incident](/posts/2024/11/01/biannual-notes#catalytic-converter-theft), so it was about 2 years overdue. But she passed inspection, and
  we've got two legal cars for the first time ever.
- Continuing on the vehicular responsibility trend: I cleaned, lubed, and
  adjusted the chain on the
[NX500](/posts/2025/06/22/weeknotes-38#nx500). Also took out a little slack in the clutch
  cable. Good as new.
- In Mandarinland, I've noticed my tone game is really lacking. I think it's
  partly because my Anki flashcards have no audio. I have no frame of reference
  for when I'm, in my head, pronouncing things badly. So I'm attempting to rectify
  this. I first installed the "Meijia (Premium)" Apple accessibility Taiwanese
  Mandarin voice. Then, in Anki, installed the
  [AwesomeTTS](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1436550454) plugin, and had it add
  audio to the new aptly-named "Audio" field of all my notes. It *seems* like it
  did a rather excellent job so far. Studying my cards now makes it clear just how
  brutally I'm butchering most of the things I'm saying. Hoping this helps.
