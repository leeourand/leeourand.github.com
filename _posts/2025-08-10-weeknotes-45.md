- Fired up the Ooni and cranked out ten pizzas for the neighborhood block
  party. People seemed to love them. Got a couple requests to do it again in a
  few weeks, which is flattering.
- Rejoined the gym. My lofty goal: three times a week. My actual performance:
  one for three. Why?
- Because I managed to catch some kind of cold. Not bad enough to stay in bed,
  but just bad enough to make everything feel like I was living inside a mildly
  foggy NyQuil ad.
- Picked up Wingspan, a board game where you attract birds to your wildlife
  preserve. Brilliant design, stunning artwork, and you get to roll dice by
  dropping them into a tiny birdhouse. I don’t know why more games don’t let
  you weaponize adorable architecture.
- Took another father–son motorcycle ride with my dad and brother. Found some
  legitimately fun twisty roads, then doubled and tripled back to ride them
  again.
