- Drove up to New York for the Labor Day weekend. Stayed with some buds who are
  about to move to Tokyo. Had a real nice time.
- Started feeling a little sick this week. Not sure if I picked up something
while in New York, or if it's just ragweed allergies (tis the season). I tried a
day of resting, and still felt the same. So tried a day of normal activity level, and
also felt the same. So yea, allergies.
- Looks like I'm losing the [eBay espresso machine dispute](/posts/2025/08/31/weeknotes-48#espresso-dispute). Buyer gets to return
it, I get to pay both directions of shipping. So here's the plan: when it
arrives, I’m going to record myself unboxing it, assembling it, and pulling a
flawless espresso shot. Then send the video to eBay and say, "Roll tape." If
this works, I get my $200 in shipping fees back. If it doesn't, at least I’ll
have a very passive-aggressive YouTube tutorial.
- Still cruising through [my new Taiwanese Mandarin textbooks](/posts/2025/08/31/weeknotes-48#taiwan-textbooks). I’d gotten lazy
with hanzi, leaning too much on pinyin. These books don't really allow that.
Result: my reading is improving, my writing is improving, and weirdly, that
makes remembering the characters easier. Apparently, studying properly is
effective. It’s like a virtuous cycle, man.
