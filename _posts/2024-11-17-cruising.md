- Went to watch Jess run the Richmond (half) Marathon on Saturday. We were able to walk over to Bellevue, which was a rather happenin' segment of the race. That neighborhood goes all out for the race, with all manner of booze, candy, and pickles for the runners.
- Had my first "range anxiety" experience with the Bolt. Drove up to have lunch with for family friend's surprise birthday celebration, and didn't take into account the range estimation being based on our usual city driving and not so much for highway driving. We still made it there and back with a whopping 15 miles left on the battery, so no big deal!
- Well, the 2024 MotoGP season has ended, and we've got a new champ! Congrats to Jorge. And also congrats to Cynthia for whippin' everyone's ass in the fantasy GP again this year.
