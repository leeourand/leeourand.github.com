- Happy November
- Dialed up the Chinese study time to about 4 hours every day this week. I added
  a couple things to my routine to help my listening skills and expand my vocab
  a bit more quickly. So I've been listening to a bunch of Mandarin podcasts and
  reading a bunch of Mandarin short stories. Also added [this zhuyin wordle
game](https://bopomofogame.com) to the daily repertoire.
- Went to the Halloween Parade with some buds. One of the perks of living in
Richmond is living among so many incredibly talented artsy folks that make these
silly events really special. A few of us popped into a tapas bar afterwards, and
got some very Halloweeny patatas bravas and some drinkies.

- Rode out to Charlottesville on the motorcycle along with Jess. Kind of failed
  in my attempt to plot a fun route out there, but the leaf peeping and the
  weather was 10/10.
- Election week... Make me proud, NYC. And make me... lukewarm, VA. Let's go!
