title: New York State of Mind
---

It's been a while. I'm alive. I'm well. I'm now living in Brooklyn. Despite what your may think of Brooklyn, I haven't yet been shot or stabbed. This is good news!

I've officially been here for six months, and I'm learning a lot. I'm still getting accustomed new faces, streets, venues, and general ways of life for New Yorkers (it apparently includes frequent brunches).

For anyone considering a move to the big city, here's a short list of things to consider:

* You'll dress better. Seriously. New York is a pretty stylish city, and you can't help but have that rub off on you a bit.
* You'll eat some amazing food. Much of it for very cheap (despite the stereotype). Pop into pretty much any little mom and pop restaurant, and enjoy.
* You'll get better at saying "no". There are quite a lot of beggars and straight up swindlers running around (especially in touristy spots). If you don't learn to ignore them, you'll wind up broke rather quickly.
* You'll become better at whatever you may think you're good at. I don't care if you're a world class bowling pin juggler, in New York, you'll find someone who's better than you at it.
* You'll stop shopping at Walmart. Yea, there aren't any of those in the city.
* You'll drink some incredible beers. New York bars have an impressively wide variety of beers. Very few bars even carry the major three beers (and their light varieties).

If you're on the fence about moving to NY, I would definitely visiting for a few days. If you're a developer, there are about 12 billion jobs available, so you needn't worry about finding a job, whether you're looking for something start-uppy or corporate.

If I've inspired you to pay NYC a visit, let me know, and I'll grab a beer with you.
