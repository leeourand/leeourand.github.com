- The sewer line work on our street that started in March finally wrapped up
this week. After six months of being woken up by heavy machinery at 6am, this
week's silence has felt fantastic.
- I've been running consistently at least 4 days a week for about 6 weeks now.
It doesn't *feel* like I'm getting any better. But the numbers don't lie: I'm
accidentally running about 1 minute per mile faster than I was 6 weeks ago, and
the VO2 max number in Apple Health has gone up monotonically after each run.
- Still no espresso machine return. Either it's lost in the mail or (and this is
my dream scenario) the buyer figured out how to grind coffee correctly, and is
too embarrassed to admit it.
- Another Italian MotoGP weekend, which means another excuse to have a pizza
party. This time I experimented with using the cliché [Caputo "00" Pizzeria
Flour](https://caputoflour.com/products/caputo-00-pizzeria). Once again, there's
apparently a reason this junk is as popular as it is. The pizzas came out really
good. I used a 70% hydration, which made things just a tad unwieldy with this
flour. Next time I'll drop down to 65%.
- Favorite silly sounding Chinese sentence I spoke this week: 我們一起吃奇異果。
(Wǒmen yīqǐ chī qíyì guǒ) I'll spare you the translation and the reason for this
utterance. Just enjoy the rapid-fire "chi" sounds.
