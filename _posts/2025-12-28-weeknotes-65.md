- Happy last week of 2025, everyone.
- Had Xmas festivities at the parents' house, along with the sibling's
  significant other's family. They were a lovely bunch, and were patient enough to
  join in on the Ourand tradition of watching Pee-Wee's Christmas Special, a true
  Christmas classic. The quantity of eggnog available may have aided in said
  patience. 
- My trickle chargers arrived, and I perma-installed the plug on the Prius, and
  charged 'er up. Haven't poked any holes in our little shed quite yet, while I
  think upon a minimally crappy way to electrify it.

  Still need to install the NX's plug, and charge it back up, too, as it's been
  sitting for a little bit. Relatedly, I've got the Honda heated
  grip kit in my shopping cart, while I ponder how seriously I want to do some
  winter-time cruisin'.
- Few more episodes into Pluribus and... wut? It seems like they almost
  immediately ran out of ideas after episode 1. Episodes 2 through 5 are almost
  entirely just filler. What am I missing?
- Twice this week, Cyn's said something to me in Mandarin, then stopped and
  asked if I understood that grammatical meaning. And both times, I did understand
  because I'd literally learned them earlier that day. She's apparently
internalized my learning progression perfectly. 加油!
