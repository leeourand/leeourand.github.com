- Happy August, everybody.
- I made *two* pretty apps this week. Not for work. Not for profit. Not sure
  what my problem is, to be honest.

  App 1 is a pizza dough calculator. It handles hydration percentages, lets you
  use poolish or biga if you’re feeling fancy, and even understands the
  difference between sourdough and active dry yeast. Honestly, it knows more
  about fermentation than I do. I’ll be using it Tuesday for our neighborhood
  block party, where I will be slinging pizzas


  App 2 is a motorcycle route planner. I pulled some knowledge from my time at
  Ride with GPS and duct-taped together something that actually works. No
  turn-by-turn navigation, no voice prompts, just dumb GPX exports. I
  load the route into OsmAnd Maps and hit the road, fully aware I'll probably
  ignore my own directions halfway through because "this road looks fun."
- Ran a couple super-slow 5K's. Not proud. Not ashamed. Just aggressively average.
- The green beans I planted into the end of our new pumpkin patch bed just no
  call no showed. So I planted a few zucchini in there instead.
