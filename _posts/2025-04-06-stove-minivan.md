- Happy April
- My daily double squirt of Flonase is completely outgunned by the rolling
  hills of pollen outside. This---among other current events---sucks, man.
- Taxes: filed! I'd been putting this task off because of all the what have
  you. But turns out, I apparently way overpaid federal taxes last year. Who'da
  guessed overpaying income taxes would be the best investment returns goin'
  right now?
- Trying to get back into some semblance of running shape. Ran a few 5K's this
  week at an easy party pace. It's always surprising to rediscover how much
  easier runs feel when it's 60 degrees than when it's over 80.
- [I caved](/posts/2025/03/23/weeknotes-25#cog-in-machine) and paid our
  ridiculously over-appraised property taxes.
- Biru decided to give anorexia a brief try. After a couple days of her basically
  eating nothing, we took her to the vet to get checked out. Got blood tests,
  poop tests, urine tests done. Surprise surprise, the very next day she's back
  to normal, and all the tests come back fine.
- Stumbled upon this excellent essay by A.R. Moxon: [One About The
  Atmosphere](https://www.the-reframe.com/one-about-the-atmosphere-reprise/).
  After recently ending conversations with a few "Stove Minivans" from my life,
  this really hit home. I wish I'd read it earlier.
