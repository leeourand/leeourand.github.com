- I don't know what's in the air, but whatever it is is running roughshod over
  my Kirkland brand "Aller-Flo" allergy relief spray. Brutal headaches every
  day. One of these days, I'm going to have to move to the desert or something.
- As promised, the sequel snow day arrived. And once again, it looks like we get
  another serving of snow tomorrow.

- Paid our first insurance premium at our new 6x higher rate for the same plan
  we've had for a year. Which is weird, because I remember---just after
  the election---being assured a certain political party had shown *no interest* in
  messing with the ACA. Huh!
- We watched the first four S5 Stranger Things episodes. So far so good. But
  that final little reveal seems teed up for some grade A silliness coming forth
  in the remaining episodes. I kind of hope they embrace it, and go for a full-on
  Dark Matter style ridiculous ending
- Been having to break out the bike pump and top up one of the tires on the car
  every couple days. Think we ran over a nail (though I haven't seen the evidence
  after a few casual inspections). After the last tire repair we had done, the
  tire completely warped and had to be replaced after just a couple months. So
  I've been hesitant to get this one "fixed". But after this week's many sub-zero
  temperature days, and having to go out and repeatedly re-inflate the thing, I've
  finally caved and made an appointment. I'm hoping we have better luck with the
  patch job this time.
