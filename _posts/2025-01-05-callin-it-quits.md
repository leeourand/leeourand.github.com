title: "Callin' It Quits"
---
- As I alluded to in [my last post](/posts/2024/12/15/gravity-golfing), I've
  got a big life change taking place this week. Tomorrow I'll quit my
  (hopefully) last job ever. I'm dippin' my toes into this [early retirement
  thing](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)
  I've been working towards over the past ~13 years or so. Right now, it feels
  a bit anticlimactic, if I'm being honest. Hopefully the significance sinks in
  in a good way in the coming weeks.

  As of now, my plans are to take 3 months, and do 3 things:
  1. Sign up for the YMCA, and make going to the gym my new job.
  2. Volunteer a bunch at Habitat for Humanity.
  3. Otherwise, [Peter Gibbons it
     up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space#Plot) (in the "do nothing"
     sense, not the back-dooring my previous employer sense). Massively-reduced
     screen time is the goal here.

  After that, I've got a million things I want to do, and I trust my curiosity
  will take me somewhere fun. We'll figure all that out when the time comes.
  For now: a little bit of a reset is in order.
- IT'S SNOWING, IT'S SNOWING...
- Squid Games season 2 is straight traaaaaash. The whole premise borders on
  idiotic. And the rapper character is insufferably corny. Then on the final episode, it...
  kind of just ends in the middle of things. Not like a cliffhanger ending, really. Just a
  "wait. What?" type of ending. Bizarre.
- What's the "Happy New Year" statute of limitations? I think we're still safe.
  Happy New Year
- I forget how I even stumbled upon it, but [this
  LiveViewNative](https://github.com/liveview-native/live_view_native) platform
  seems super-neat. Instead of the typical web view style (a la Turbo Native),
  this is actually rendering SwiftUI components from a Phoenix server. There
  are obviously tradeoffs in doing things this way (e.g., you still have to
  write separate views for each client: web, iOS, android, watch, etc.) But
  it's a totally valid option for "easy" native mobile apps that I didn't know
  existed.
