- Helped setup some solar panels at the farm. They'll be harnessing the power
  of the sun to hydrate all our various plant buddies.
- Went on a few exploratory motorcycle rides, trying to find some fun roads
  around Richmond. Haven't exactly been successful in finding any particularly
  good ones, but have stumbled upon some scenic routes, at the very least. I later learned one such scenic sites [was actually a prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_River_Correctional_Center). Lovely.

  *The corn seemed unimpressed by my engine’s roar. Tough crowd.*
- I "vibe coded" this [dumb little subtitle
  hunter](https://github.com/leeourand/subtitle-hunter) app this week.
  Background: Cyn likes watching things with Traditional Chinese subtitles. But
  finding them is a multi-step ritual that takes like 5-10 minutes each. Find
  and download English subs. Translate them. Re-download. Upload through the
  Jellyfind UI that only works on your second try for reasons no one quite
  understands. So I built a one-click tool to do it all. It's still dumb, but
  *efficiently* dumb.
- Went to Cyn's hot yoga class as a student for the first time since she
  started teaching. She teaches one mean yoga class. I don't think I've ever
  been sweatier while technically standing still.
- 這週我們一直在嘗在家裡多說中文。我不能聽好。
  (We've been trying to speak more Mandarin at home this week. My skills are somewhere between "disappointing" and "that didn't make any sense.")
