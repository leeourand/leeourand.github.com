Color me shocked!

> Gullibility appears to cut across party lines, with respondents identifying as Democrats just as likely as Republicans to believe at least one of the 10 false claims.

Yea, ok. Go on... Let's read the very next paragraph:

> Republicans were, though, more likely to believe Russian disinformation claims than their Democratic counterparts, with 57.6% falling for at least one Russian disinformation claim, compared with just 17.9% of Democrats and 29.5% of people who didn't identify with one particular party.

Oh! So Democrats are *not* "just as likely as Republicans" to believe at least one of the 10 false claims. Both-sidesism is just incredible.
