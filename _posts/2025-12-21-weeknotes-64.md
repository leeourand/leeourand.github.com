- Spent a few days driving back-and-forth to Williamsburg to work on a secret
Christmas gift for Cyn, utilizing my dad for some fatherly woodworking wisdom
and tools. Like most work estimates, this took a lot longer than expected. But
I'm really pumped with how they (there's another identical unpictured frame)
turned out.

- Bolt tire: repaired! Whole week with no low pressure warning.
- Started watching Pluribus. We're just two episodes in, but really diggin' it.
- Our cold weather snap, like it did last year, murdered our poor Prius battery.
So I've acquired some trickle chargers. Next step will be rigging up some hacky
extension cord based way of getting power into the shed to protect the outlets
from the weather, and also keep my motorcycle battery topped up.
