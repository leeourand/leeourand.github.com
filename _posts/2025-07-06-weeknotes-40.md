- Installed some quality-of-life upgrades on the bike this week. We've now got
  a phone charger courtesy of the OEM cigarette port charger. Technically, this
  means I'm also prepared for all those times I need to light up a Marlboro
  inside my melon bucket. Also added a center stand, and a top box. I'm nearing
  40 years old, my motorcycle now has a trunk, and I'm emotionally at peace
  with that.

- Did a little more farm volunteering. Jess joined for this one. We put up a
  wooden picket fence at the back of the farm. The weather has gotten to the
  point where, after about 20 minutes of modest work, the charming fantasy of
  working a farm for a living quickly dissolves into, "Ok, air conditioning is
  among humanity's finest achievements." Desk jobs don't seem so bad, afterall.
- After farm work, we met up with Cyn, and went to [Pho Tay
  Do](https://pho-tay-do.menu-buzz.com/) for lunch. Still undefeated.
- Met up with the guy I was trying to buy the used NX500 from. He was a total
  gentleman, and returned my deposit while the DMV continues holding his title hostage somewhere in the seventh circle of bureaucracy. Sure hope someone might someday get to own that bike.
- Had a low-key Fourth get-together. Burgers, beers, and nobody lost a single appendage.
- Did a tiny, slow Capital Trail bike ride with the gang Saturday morning,
  then followed it up with a trip to one of Richmond's finest public pools. The
  pool was 95% good vibes and 5% genuine public health concern. Nothing like a quick dip
  punctuated by: "Hey, is that person overdosing?"
- Really locking in that peak summer nostalgia, we re-watched Season 1 of Stranger Things
