title: Groundhog
subtitle: Even he's not feelin' too optimistic about this year

- Welcome back. And Happy Groundhog Day
- We've officially expanded our gardening
operation by a whopping 50% (went from 2 to 3 raised beds). I carved up our
Christmas tree and tossed it in the bottom of the raised bed to make a
[Hügelkultur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hügelkultur) type thing. Emptied out
one side of our compost tumbler to fill out most of the rest, and topped it off
with some top soil we had layin' around.
- Went on a not-quite-a-hike around [Maymont](https://maymont.org) yesterday,
and enjoyed the relatively lovely weather.
- We attempted to begin a Star Wars movie extravaganza this weekend. But the
Mandarin subtitles I was able to find from OpenSubtitles are all kinds of a
mess. George Lucas's fascination with adding random cut scenes to the various
editions of his movies really goofs up one's ability to find decent subtitles.
After the 7th adjustment, where we had to offset the subtitles by over 2 minutes, we
just gave up.
- Speaking of Mandarin, I've resumed my Duolingo Mandarin practice. I just got
to the first section where I practice writing Hanzi. It's damn hard to remember
the direction / order to draw each stroke of each character. I can't figure out
the "rule" beyond ~roughly: left → right / top → bottom. Hoping it eventually
sinks in, but at this still early moment, it feels like a borderline hopeless
exercise.
- I made Taiwanese Sticky Rice(油飯) for dinner on Thursday as a belated Lunar
New Year treat. It came out decently well for a first attempt. The recipe I followed had
you make fried shallots, then add them to the rice, then steam the rice. So it
completely destroyed the delicate delicious little crunchy onion bastards. That
seems like a mistake. Will make some adjustments next time.
- To deal with the whole Prius battery dilemma, I just bought a new AGM battery
from Costco. Popped that thing in (again, what a pain in the butt, Toyota!), it
just worked. Good as new. I had my dad pop the old battery on his trickle
charger for a day to see if it would still hold a charge. It appears it does! So
now I've got a spare 12V battery I need to find a use for. Solar powered rain
barrel pump project? Powered fence gate opener mechanism? The possibilities are
endless!
