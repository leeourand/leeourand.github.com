- Finished reading [The Courage To Be
  Disliked](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/28473aa9-7e42-4ce1-9cb2-2534d9629ccd)
  per a [Justin Searls
  recommendation](https://justin.searls.co/mails/2023-12/). It's a very odd
  format, where the whole book is basically the dialogue between a student and
  a adlerian philosopher. This was my first exposure to Adler. Much of it feels
  dismissive of people's problems---unempathetic, maybe?! But it's an
  interesting angle, nonetheless. It caused me to do a little reflection on my
  own thought-patterns. Too early to tell if any lasting good will come from it.
- Once again obliterated my feet attempting to not get killed---and failing--in
  pickleball. I've acquired new shoes, so hopefully we can put this painful
  saga behind us.
- Made a new bud at the pickle ball courts. He's from China originally, so I
  utilized a few of my recently learned Chinese words to tell him: 我會説中文一點點 ("I can speak
  a little Chinese!"). He (very generously) said I pronounced it perfectly. I
  left the Chinese speaking there, so as to not embarrass myself any further.
- Neat week for the stock market, eh? It looks like I've pretty much nailed
  [the worst possible timing for quitting
  work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sequence-risk.asp). This
  retirement thing may be rather short lived.
- Hosted a little pizza party for Pi Day. Cooked up 6 pizzas on the Ooni. Used
  my 50/50 bread flour/00 flour @ 70% hydration recipe, and it came out just
  perfectly. Won't change a thing next time.
- Celebrated St. Patrick---famed pincher and drinker of green beer---at Jess's.
  He cooked up a meddley of Irish-themed fare, plus a couple Irish Coffees (or,
  as they call them in Ireland: coffees).
- MotoGP round 2 is in the books. Another Marquez brothers demolition job. I
  know it's probably going to get old quick if it's anything like many of
  Marc's pre-2020 seasons. But for now, I'm happily cheering it on.
