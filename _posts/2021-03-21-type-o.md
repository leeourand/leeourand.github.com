- Lots of people around me are getting vaccinated---including my parents. It finally feels like the
  end of this pandemic is in sight. With summer approaching, I'm really looking
  forward to the possibility of some semblance of non-pandemic normalcy.
- Spring is upon us, and it feels so good. Last year, we heard nonstop how NY
  was dead. This weekend proved otherwise.
- The first race of the MotoGP season is next week. It's a little sad to see
  Valentino Rossi move down to the satellite team. But good grief does his
  setup look excellent.
