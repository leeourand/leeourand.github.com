- Since I'm wrapping up Volume 1 of the [A Course in Contemporary
Chinese](http://www.mtc.ntnu.edu.tw/eng/book/A_Course_in_Contemporary_Chinese.html),
I submitted my order for books 2 through 6, and NTNU emailed me back suggesting
I don't buy them because of tariff complications. So that's neat.
- Played around with [Godot](https://godotengine.org) for the first time in a
few years. Just built the two tutorial games: the 2D and 3D ones. Since my last
brief tinkering in Godot, they've added optional static typing to GDScript.
Since most of the stdlib is typed, it provides some really excellent error
messages right in the editor. Makes for a pretty pleasant experience.
- Volunteered pickin' up trash in the neighborhood. Altogether, our group of 6
picked up ~45lbs of trash. Most hilarious single piece of trash I found was a
bag of 5 perfectly-normal looking hard-boiled eggs. Frank Reynolds's head would
explode. Perfect condition!
- Did some two-wheeled Fall-time adventure days.

- Went to the [Bellwether Garage](https://www.instagram.com/bellwether_garage/),
  and saw [Miracle Time](https://miracletimerva.bandcamp.com), [Isaac
Friend](https://isaacfriend.bandcamp.com/), and Theocles play. It was my first
time seeing a show there. All three artists were excellent. And the blocked-off
street / garage setup was unique. I even got to peep some excellent vintage
motorcycles they'd wheeled out to make room for the bands.
- Had Cyn list my Flair 58 espresso machine on Facebook Marketplace to avoid
dealing with eBay again. Sold it almost immediately to a super-nice dude
who is a legit espresso nerd, and seemed excited about putting it to use.
Lesson learned. eBay: yuh dead to me.
