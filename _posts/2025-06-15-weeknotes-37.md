- What a week...
- Cyn passed her real estate tests on her first try 🎉 I helped her study a
  bit, and the questions were written in some kind of bar-exam-meets James
  Joyce dialect, with quadruple negatives and the occasional logic trap. I
  can't imagine sussing that mess out in a second language, but she managed to
  nail it. 我的老婆很聰明
- Went to the No Kings march here in Richmond. Haven't seen official numbers,
  but there must've been at least 12, maybe 13 billion people there. My
  favorite sign I saw: ![A sign saying Do Due Process. Not doo-doo

- You're not going to believe it, but this week will be **week 8** of waiting
  for the DMV to correct a motorcycle title with one missing 0. One of the
  things I was most looking forward to, when I bought this bike 8 weeks ago,
  was going on a Father's Day motorcycle ride with my dad. Thanks for ruining
  that for us, DMV! If this new title isn't hand-chiseled into a slab of
  granite, I'm going to be very upset.
- Around 9 months ago, the pump on our washing machine died, and I got a new
  pump, and replaced it. That replacement pump just kicked the bucket, so I get
  to do it again.
- Speaking of water-removal-apparatuses failing: our new dehumidifier arrived.
  I installed that bad-boy this week, and it hasn't yet burst into flames or
  flooded the house. That feels like a small success! Considering how much
  cheaper it was than the last one, I'm now excited to find out whether I
  actually got a deal or a humbling betrayal awaits me.
