- Remembered I had a handful of smart plugs I wasn't using, so plugged the new Christmas tree lights into one of those bad-boys, and we're now scheduled.
- As predicted, I fell off the Advent of Code exercises pretty quick. But I got through ~5 of 'em, including [this masterpiece of ugliness](https://github.com/leeourand/AOC2024/blob/main/day03/day03.go)! Don't judge me, I'm just embracing that whole [worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better) idea.
- My comfort in the Metaverse has increased substantially this week! Upgraded the Quest with some shiny new Zenni lenses so I can see spectacle-free and a new head strap that's miles better than the cheap dingus Meta sells the thing with.
- Met up with some friends for brunch and boozin' on Saturday. The brewery we wound up at happens to also stock [Uncool](https://drinkuncool.com) non-alcoholic beers. It was my first exposure to them, and I gotta say: I like the branding. And the beer was actually pretty decent too, as far as N/A beers go, anyway.
- Ordered up my tasting kit for the [The Decaf Project](https://www.thedecafproject.com) and ready to compare the results from these decaffeination methods.
