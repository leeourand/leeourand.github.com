- Happy first week of Fall to all who celebrate.
- Welp. My returned espresso machine arrived in the mail, and I followed through on [my brilliant plan](/posts/2025/09/07/weeknotes-49#espresso-return-plan) for disputing eBay's dumb decision to refund the espresso buyer. They rejected my appeal with some bland canned reply. And I can tell they didn't even watch the video I so painstakingly recorded, because the only web log entry is mine. So now I've got my fully functional espresso machine back, and I'm $150 poorer than I started.

  I tried escalating through eBay's "secret" phone support. The first rep left me on hold for about 35 minutes while she was "trying to pull up my account". She then updated me that her supervisor had fixed the problem, but we'd need to first disconnect the call, and she'd call me right back. Shockingly, that return call never came. So I called back, got a different rep, got a supervisor on the line, and also had no luck. After explaining eBay had already made their decision, there was nothing she could do, but she then brilliantly suggested I "simply re-list the item for $150 more than I sold it for last time" to recoup my losses. So, y'know. eBay's really running a tight ship over there.
- Another week of completely predictable and horrific political nightmare fuel.
  It's remarkable how few people seem to know two pretty basic things:
  1. [Who](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lupkfad5p52v) [was](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3ltzhhb62oy2n) [president](https://gizmodo.com/marc-andreessen-seems-to-think-hillary-clinton-was-actually-president-2000552062) [prior](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lv6wwy3osx2f) [to](https://archive.is/YKQpv#:~:text=we,away) [January 20, 2021](https://xcancel.com/Acyn/status/1959420907379970220). And
  2. The difference between the federal government quelling speech vs someone
     facing consequences from friends, employers, or the general public for what
  they say.
- Been slacking on my gym routine, trying to avoid irritating my [weird hand bump](/posts/2025/08/31/weeknotes-48#hand-bump). Dermatologist appointment is this week. So hopefully they can do something, and I can return to my pursuit of Getting Yugeâ„¢.
