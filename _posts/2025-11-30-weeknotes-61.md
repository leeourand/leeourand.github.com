- And another month in the books.
- Rigged up a way to watch TV using my digital antenna over the internet while
at my parents' house for Thanksgiving football purposes. Like clockwork, my home
internet turned to garbage as soon as we wanted to watch, and there was much
buffering.
- Back to the gym routine after much excuse-production.
- The Anki flashcard review session, since adding audio and "again"ing myself
for not using the right tones, has grown into a beast. My review on Tuesday was
almost 2 hours. So I've paused learning new words for a bit while we get this
back under control. Today's review looks like it'll be around 35 minutes, so
we're approaching reasonable again.
