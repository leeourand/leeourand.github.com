- We finished watching The Beast Inside Me. Was a fun show. The end was a little
  too predictable and it felt rushed.
- I finished the first volume of my A Course in Contemporary Chinese textbooks /
  workbooks! I began volume 2, which starts out with giving & receiving
  directions—something I’m horrifically bad at in English. Send me all the good
  vibes.
- First snow of the year, and looks like we’ll quickly be getting the sequel
  tomorrow.
- Knocked out a few Advent of Code puzzles. After nearly a year of almost no
  programming practice, I can say: this old man's still got it!
- Gym'd a few times... Fine. Dandy.
- I ponied up the cash for the iOS version of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net).
  After using all the various free versions for the past few months, figured it
  would be nice to toss a little money their way. Plus, the iOS version---unlike
  the web version---supports text-to-speech. So I've been able to stop creating
  ad-hoc audio files on my mac. Tiny achievements!
- Speaking of, I crossed the 1,000 "note" milestone in Anki. So, ballpark, that
  means I can read, speak, understand around 1,000 Chinese words now. That still
  places me squarely in "childlike" territory. So we've got a ways to go.
