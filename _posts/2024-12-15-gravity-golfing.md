- I got a notification that the coffee for [The Decaf Project](https://www.thedecafproject.com) was delivered successfully to a P.O. box. I don't have a P.O. box, so that was odd. After reaching out to the fine folks at [Reserva](https://www.reservacoffee.com), they confirmed they'd shipped it to my actual address, so it was a USPS mistake, but they decided to ship out a second set super-quickly. Just got the coffee this weekend, and it's fantastic. Also really cool to try side-by-side coffees that have been decaffeinated using different processes. Cynthia and I both enjoyed the one decaffeinated via CO2 Subcritical Decaffeination. Our least favorite, sadly, was the Swiss Water process, which I was kind of hoping to like, since it seemed the simplest. But the taste buds felt differently.
- [Walkabout Mini Golf](https://www.mightycoconut.com/minigolf) is just a treasure. I've been playing a decent bit, and my first pass through any course, I just have a dumb smile plastered on my face. I just wrapped up playing the [Upside Town](https://www.mightycoconut.com/upside-town) course vs Jess, and it was nonstop laughs. Some really clever design, fully taking advantage of the VR medium.
- Spent some time battling a super-slow MySQL query at work. Turns out (at least in this case?), MySQL sucks at `OR`ing things, and can handle `UNION`ing things just fine. So... there you go. Hot tip du jour.
- Made some big decisions that I'm not quite ready to share yet, but I'm nonetheless excited about.
- Baked my first sourdough in a while. My scoring could use some work, but otherwise, it came out pretty great.
