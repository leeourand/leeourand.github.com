- Our crawlspace dehumidifier seems to have kicked the bucket. I first thought
  maybe the filter was too clogged, and that was causing the coils to freeze.
  But after replacing the filter, giving it a couple hours to rest, and
  re-starting the thing, it still ran at full tilt, doing precisely nothing.
  It's far too cramped down there to do any real troubleshooting, so next step
  is to yank it out, and see if I can figure out what's wrong.
- Our three-year wedding anniversary was on Tuesday. ❤️ Did our traditional
  Mexican lunch feast at our new favorite local Mexican joint.
- More farm work this week. This time we put down a bunch of lime to try to
  boost the soil's pH from its current ridiculous three-point-something level.
- The motorcycle titling fix wait continues. Going on week 5 now... It's one
  missing zero, Michael, how long could it take?
- Went ahead and acquired a helmet and gloves for this still-anticipitory
  motorcycle.
- Silverstone GP weekend 🇬🇧. Wild races all around. Poor Quartararo's ride height
  device giving out while he had a ~5 second lead is one of the crueller
  outcomes we've seen.
- Dan Sinker's latest [The Who Cares
  Era](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/) is so good.

  > In the Who Cares Era, the most radical thing you can do is care.

  Go give it a read if you haven't already.
