subtitle: "...with Go"

- I picked up Thorsten Ball's [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com) book, and have been slowly working my way through it. You can follow along on [my journey to implement Monkeylang](https://github.com/leeourand/monkeylang).
- Speaking of Go, I'm planning on attempting this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in Go this year. Before I get overwhelmed and or tired of it, like I do every year, anyway.
- I finally stopped procrastinating the installation of my new POE cameras, and spelunked into the crawlspace to do some drilling. It didn't go great, so project has once again been suspended. Just ordered a flexible drillbit, some fishing tape, and an oscillating multitool to help this go a bit more smoothly. We'll try again next week!
- Jess acquired a Quest3, which he let us all tinker around with. I hadn't tried VR anything in probably 10 years. It's seriously impressive how far that technology has progressed. Playing iRacing in VR made me feel uneasy within literal seconds of pushing the gas pedal. I was full-on motion sick within 2 laps. Pretty brutal. Less motiony stuff---like the paddle golf game---was really cool, though. I'm contemplating picking one up for myself just to try my hand at the whole "spatial computing" idea without forking over the cash for an Apple Vision Pro.
- Time to start mentally preparing my digestive tract for the annual Ourand Thanksgiving Day Hot Pot Feast of Feasts.
