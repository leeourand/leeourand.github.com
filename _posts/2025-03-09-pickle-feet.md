- Marc Marquez is undisputedly back! Unfortunately, that probably means a
  boring 2025 MotoGP season awaits us. But what an incredible comeback story
  this could be.
- Foolishly played a couple hours of Pickle Ball on Thursday in my old beat up
  Vans Authentic shoes, resulting in some gnarly foot blisters. Oops. Lesson
  learned there! Proper footwear: important.
- While we're on the topic of pickle ball, I acquired my very own set of pickle
  ball ~~racquets~~ paddles. Sad to report, I still absolutely suck. But I did win two
  games (of probably 30) this week. So you could say things are improving.
- National Pancake Day: the second round.

- Some days, it feels like learning Mandarin to a useful degree is just
  unrealistic. Other days, it really feels like things are clicking.
  Yesterday---after finally understanding how to use äº†---felt like the latter.

- Remade the same eggplant dish I [made a couple weeks
  back](/posts/2025/02/16/sprouting#sprouting-eggplant), but cut out all the
  funny business: no pre-salting, no deep frying. About a bajillion times
  easier, and it came out every bit as good.
- Migrated our onion sets out to the raised bed garden. Fingers cross't for no more frost. ðŸ¤ž
