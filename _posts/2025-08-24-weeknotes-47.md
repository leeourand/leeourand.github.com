- Continued the gym streak. And tacked on a bonus exercise-related streak of
running at least 1 mile every day this week. Yes, _a_ mile. The bar is low, but
this bar is mine.
- Listed my old espresso machine on eBay, and people are actually bidding. Which
means this espresso machine swaparoo might end with me ahead financially. Rarely
in life do you replace a complicated hobby with a slightly less complicated
hobby and make money. Feels like I've figured out adulthood.
- Had another farm / food pantry assistin' day. We harvested and donated 130lbs
  of veggies. This haul was mostly tomatoes, but also basil, and bell peppers.
- Finished reading [Tiny
Experiments](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214268997-tiny-experiments). I
loved it. I'll be putting some of its hot tips to use. It just happens to line
up nicely with where I'm at in life. Not sure I'd generally recommend it.
But if you have an abundance of free time, and you're in the right headspace to
enjoy it, it's a good read.
- Cyn and I went to the Richmonder Taiwanese summer event, and ate some
[Baobing (刨冰)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhoah-peng)---a chaotic mound of
shaved ice, fruit, beans, tofu, taro, and whatever fits in the bowl. It's like a
dessert version of a flea market. Saw some familiar faces, met some new faces,
and once again, got to impress people whose exceptionally low expectations match
perfectly with my very limited Mandarin skills.
