- Started the week off with a bang by going to the dentist. My cavity-free
  streak continues, and my tongue has some smoother surfaces to rub against.
- Hosted a little game night, and played some good old fashioned Pictionary.
  Few inconsequential things in life demonstrate how poorly most people's
  brains function under pressure than Pictionary. I repeatedly failed to guess
  the most obvious drawings imagineable. And I wasn't exactly unique.
- Got an update on the DMV title fixing situation for the motorcycle I'm
  buying. We got off to a real rough start, with the USPS apparently taking 9
  days to deliver the paperwork from Charlottesville, VA to Richmond, VA. The
  wait continues.
  In the mean time, I bought some Zenni glasses, which were delivered,
  presumably from China, in about 5 days. We live in incredible times!
- Went to our first Flying Squirrels game of the year, which was
  Squirreltoberfest themed for some reason. Drank a beer. Ate some
  squirrely-fries. Had a real nice time.
- Raced in the second annual Gaycathlon as the formidable "green team".
  Results-wise, let's just say we got neither first nor last. But we raised a
  little money for [a good cause](https://www.hips.org/) and had a silly time
  doing it.
- Got a bunch of rain this week, which thankfully topped off our empty rain
  barrel. Free water for the garden is once again plentiful!
