- I recently stumbled upon [Tom Stuart's](https://tomstu.art) Weekly Notes, and
  was inspired by the simplicity of keeping a weekly set of notes. So, let's
  embrace the opportunity to start anew.
- I wrapped up Jason Hickel&rsquo;s [Less is
  More](https://www.jasonhickel.org/less-is-more). It's is an excellent read
  about the incompatibility of growth-based capitalism with environmental
  sustainability. I used to have the naive idea that GDP could continue to grow
  while we transitioned to sustainable energy production. Hickel pretty
  thouroughly debunks that idea. Eye opening and mostly hopeful book.
  Definitely recommend it.
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law">Gall's
  Law</a> came up at work this week. It states:
  > A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a
  > simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never
  > works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with
  > a working simple system.
- I've been playing [Dead by
  Daylight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight) with some buds for
  a few weeks now. It's grown on me. It's a hilarious-to-play asymmetrical
  survival game where four survivors try to escape from a killer. Best played
  with friends on voice chat so you can hear teammates scream bloody murder as
  they're found by the killer.
