- After last week's snow, [Richmond's water system was knocked completely out](https://archive.is/5sGUR). Water utilities are one of those things that receive zero fanfare, and are just kind of taken for granted. Looks like, Richmond's had been neglected for a _long time_, including being headed by a wholly unqualitified University of Phoenix grad with zero engineering background. Wild. Hoping this kickstarts some much needed infrastructure investment in this city (and removing lots of past nepotism hires).
- Friday was my last day of work. We made it. Wrapping up this 13 year early retirement project feels less significant than I'd expected.

- Signed up for the YMCA in preparation for gym session #1 tomorrow
- Cynthia and I were pushing the limits of our 200GB Family iCloud storage plan. I took that as a challenge to figure out an alternative to paying Apple a relatively absurd $11per month for the next storage tier. I wound up installing [Immich](https://immich.app) on our NAS. It's an aboslute delight so far! Really, it's a nice piece of software. The web app is much more feature-rich and faster than Apple's own iCloud Photos web app. The mobile app is roughly equivalent to Apple's. 

  Hot tip for anyone attempting something similar: the Immich iOS app allows you to set an internal server address when your phone is on the same network as the server. Do this. It makes photo uploads *much* faster than having to go out over the internet.
- We went to watch the VCU women's basketball game. Close game and VCU came out the victors.
