- More pickleballin' this week. Won 3 of the 7 games I played. I'm getting better, slowly, apparently!
- After spending way too much time thinking about motorcycle helmets, think
  I've landed on what I'm going to get: the LS2 Advant X. It's one of only a
  handful of helmets sold in the U.S. with both DOT and ECE 22.06 safety
  standards.
- And now I've moved onto overthinking other motorcycle safety gear: gloves,
  jacket, pants, boots, and learning about CE ratings for motorcycle garments.
- Did some more farm working this week. Primarily helped till up the soil where
  the rows will soon go.
- Our magnolia tree has begun its spring time leaf dropping. Magnolia trees go
  onto my list of things to avoid whenever our next housing search happens.
- Le Mans MotoGP week. I did some French baking for the occasion, making some
  baguettes and some macarons. Baguettes are comparatively easy peasy. Those
  macarons were about a 7/10 pain in the neck. The French gods apparently saw fit
  to reward my dedication with the first French MotoGP race winner since 1974!
