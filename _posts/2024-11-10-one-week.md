- After [some schmucks stole our car's catalytic
  converter](http://lee.ourand.me/posts/2024/11/01/biannual-notes) I took the
  car to a local mechanic to see what it'd cost to fix. They quoted me over
  $4k. I'm much too cheap for that nonsense. So I bought the parts myself, and
  just completed the work tonight. All in, it cost me about $400 and a couple
  hours wrenchin' with my dad. Not a bad deal!
- Relatedly, I'll be installing a couple security cameras outside the house.
  Just acquired a spool of cat 6 cable, some reolink cameras, and will be
  trying a proper PoE setup after my current wifi cameras failed spectacularly. 
- Oh yea. An election happened. And... what an indictment that is of us
  Americans. We are a stupid, angry, hateful bunch of people. We need help.
- We binge watched
  [Disclaimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclaimer_(TV_series)) this week.
  It was really good. My only gripe is that it was maybe a bit too graphic at
  times. It took me a bit to recognize Kevin Kline, who's less hilarious than
  in his usual roles.
- I went to a bar that had live music. The artist started singing a song with
  the lyrics "who put PCP in the lobster chowder?". It was a catchy little
  tune, so I had to look it up, and was shocked to discover that this was a
  real story that happened [while filming The Titanic in
  1999](https://www.vulture.com/2022/12/25-years-later-no-one-knows-who-spiked-the-titanic-chowder.html).
