title: "Home Cooking"

So the start of the new year is upon us. As is expected, I'm hearing a lot of the usual New Year's resolutions: "I want to lose weight", "I want to save money", "I want to eat healthier", etc. It just so happens that there is a pretty easy solution to these things: cook your own food, you heathen!

Last year, I made an effort to start cooking food at home more often. I've lost a bit of weight, I've saved a fair bit of money (over $4,000 last year), and I've picked up some fine kitchen skills. You can call me Chef Boyar Lee. Make that Chef Boyar Lee the Rich and Skinny.

If you're looking for some inspiration on how you can cook at home more, feast your eyes upon my 4 tips for upping your kitchen badassery:

1. **Plan a few recipes for the week.**
Planning ahead of time will make your grocery shopping way less stressful. Bring a list of all the ingredients you need, and buy nothing else.

2. **Double (or Triple) the recipe.** That Five Guy's burger you eat every week? Yea. Forget about that mess. By cooking ginormous recipes, you'll have plenty of leftovers to take to work.

3. **Pick up some tupperware if you have none.** You'll want to have plenty of tupperware for all of those leftovers.

4. **Know a few easy-to-toss-together meals.** I like rice and beans, pasta & pasta-sauce, rice bowls, and salads. They're easy to make on nights I don't want to cook and don't want to dip into my leftover stash.

It's not too late to start a New Year's resolution. Well, technically, it is I guess. But you should start cooking anyways. To get you started, here are a few of my go-to recipes.
