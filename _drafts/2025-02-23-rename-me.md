- I've gotten a bit spoiled already, and pretty much can't stand going anywhere
  during peak hours when John Q. Public is off work. I forgot Monday was a
  federal holiday, and went to a local cafe to get a little afternoon coffee
  with Cynthia until we saw the crowd. We noped out of there, and I made some
  fancy coffees at home instead. <insert some pithy line about voters' economic
  anxiety>
- I migrated the bell pepper seeds to sit on top of the refrigerator, thinking
  some heat may help 'em sprout. It worked! Looks like we'll be swimming in
  bell peppers by the summer as planned.
- Went to a freshly constructed library near us just to get out of the house. I
  tinkered around with [Loco](https://loco.rs/) for a bit while there. 
- More snow! I'm really just over it, man.
