title: "Kick Your Lazier Self's Butt"
---

Like any other human, sometimes I feel lazy. Or unmotivated. Or I lack
discipline. I've found a way to conquer these feelings: I imagine a lazy
version of myself living inside myself, and I routinely piss him off
by not doing what he wants. Every time my lazy alter ego thinks "you should take
a break" or "I'm comfortable; I don't want to do `<blank>`", I smile and
make that jerk miserable.

People often suggest setting goals as the solution to feeling
unambitious. Sometimes goals are fine, but most people set goals like
dummies. Goals that can be affected by outside forces are goals you
can fail to reach. Reaching a goal can feel quite good. Failing to reach a goal—especially for someone
already feeling unambitious—can be devastating. 

For an example of how a traditional goal is flawed, let's say you make a goal of running a marathon by
`<date>`. You begin training, and things are going well. 
Just a few weeks before the marathon, some big guy pops out of nowhere, kicks you, and breaks
your leg. You're *probably* not going to be able to run this race, and
therefore will have failed to meet your goal. Bummer.

Since your alter-ego is impacted by the same externalities you are, a better goal—an internal goal—would be to train to the best of your
ability; dragging your lazy alter-ego along kicking and screaming. An easy way to gauge whether you've tried hard enough is to
ask yourself if your lazy alter-ego was made sufficiently uncomfortable today. If it was, you've succeeded; good job!

This method of motivation may sound familiar because it's based upon the idea of one's
"circle of control". Without getting too philosophical, there are three categories of things:

1. Things you have complete control over (like your goals, thoughts, decisions)
2. Things you have partial control over (arm wrestling, learning to dance)
3. Things you have no control over (the stock market, sports teams)

Ideally, you would concern yourself heavily with the first category. You would
concern yourself some with the second category. You should not waste a minute of
your life worrying, stressing, celebrating, or otherwise giving a shit
about category three. Tying emotion to things outside your control
allows for externalities to control *you*. Obviously nobody is
completely invulnerable from outside forces, but one should make a
concerted effort to limit their impact.

Enthusiastic sports fans ritualistically invest emotion into things they
have no control over. We've all seen a grown man crying because his favorite sportsball team lost. His emotions are controlled via external sources; he is not in an enviable position. Don't be like that guy.

This has been a powerful trick for me. It's like having a competition
with my lazier self. And since I'm competing with *myself*, I can use this technique for literally anything I do. As long as I give it an honest effort, I can always win. And winning in a competition against laziness can yield great rewards.
